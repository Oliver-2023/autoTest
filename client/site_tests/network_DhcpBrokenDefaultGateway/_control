  Tests that we can negotiate a lease on an IPv4 address via DHCP from
  a server that provides a broken default gateway option.  Specifically,
  the gateway provided is outside the broadcast domain specified by the
  client IP address and prefix.  This test verifies that the client
  mitigates this issue by creating a link-scoped route to the gateway,
  or via some other method which allows the gateway route to be
  successfully added.

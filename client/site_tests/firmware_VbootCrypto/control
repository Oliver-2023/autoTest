This test implements various RSA and SHA by creating and verifying various
keys and hashes. It will generate public key signatures using sha1, sha256,
and sha512 algorithms with key lengths of 1024, 2048, 4096, and 8192. RSA
padding tests will then be run to verify them. Tests are also run to verify
the correctness of firmware and kernel image verification.

# Note: This test is currently only intended for manual runs in
# a "well controlled" enviroment.  This test is primarily intended for
# use in Ethernet AVL qual and the "records" should land in a related bug.
# Compare the information recorded with later runs if there is a problem.
#
# I strongly encourage users to record the configuration (DUT mfg/model,
# Ethernet mfg/model, Chrome OS version, BIOS Version, etc.) and test
# results (histogram of the time to restore link) in a spreadsheet.
# One can then use the spreadsheet to track differences when there
# is a regression in a "known" configuration.

# Description
# Runs eight minutes of bare suspend/resume cycles without additional workload.
# Follows this by a few short checks to make sure the system is still in a good
# state (work in progress, feel free to add some more).
# Put .bare in a loop and run for 2 days.  This test replaces suspend resume test.

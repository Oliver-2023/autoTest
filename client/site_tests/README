This directory contains client-side test cases for ChromiumOS,
classified by test area. See
https://github.com/autotest/autotest/wiki/AutotestApi for documentation on the
distinction between client side tests and server side tests.

Test cases should exist no more than one level deep, using autotest
naming conventions.

CRITERIA = """
This test will fail if one of the following conditions occurs:
  - Shill destroys a service due to temporary registration loss
  - Shill never destroys a service after permanent registration loss
"""
TIME = "SHORT"
TEST_CATEGORY = "Functional"
TEST_CLASS = "network"
TEST_TYPE = "client"
DOC = """
  Tests that shill can handle temporary registration loss without destroying
  the service because some modems periodically go searching for a better signal
  while still connected to the network.  Additionally, make sure that shill
  still destroys a service that has suffered a registration loss for an
  extended period of time (>15s).

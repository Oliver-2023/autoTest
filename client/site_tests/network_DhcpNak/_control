  Tests handling of DHCP NAK messages. In particular, tests that
  we accept DHCP NAK messages without a server-id. This is necessary
  because some DHCP servers do not include a server-id in their
  NAKs.

  The test will fail if dhcpcd does not restart the DHCP process
  when it receives a NAK without a server-id.

DOC = """
Intel x86 CPUs (Sandybridge and later) reserve a portion of the BIOS
firmware image for use by the Intel Management Engine (ME). Intel
requires that section of the BIOS flash to be mutable. The ME firmware
itself determines whether or not the CPU can modify the ME region. During
development, we often use an ME image that allows CPU updates. For
production, we need to ensure that we do NOT allow CPU updates.

This test PASSES if the CPU is unable to modify the ME region.

This test FAILS if the CPU can modify the ME region, which means it should
*always* fail on any pre-production image.

Because the only way to be sure that the ME is locked is to try to change
it, if the test fails and is interrupted before it can restore the original
content, the DUT may stop functioning and will require reimaging via servo
or Dediprog to restore it.

This test is only meaningful to systems using Intel x86 CPUs, and then only
Sandybrige models or later (not Pinetrail, for example)

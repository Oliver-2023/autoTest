Verifies kernel gem objects and memory info values can be read from sysfs.
We also report these values to the perf dashboard. To make them a bit more
repeatable we wait for the login screen to load (hack).

TODO(ihf): It would be better to report this after running a non-browser
           test like graphics_GLBench.

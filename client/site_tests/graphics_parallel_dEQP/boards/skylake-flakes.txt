# Note that Skylake boards (asuka, at least) can have a GT1 and GT2
# variant, and this can impact the set of tests that fail, but we
# don't distinguish them in testing.  So, some failing cases end up
# listed here as flakes even if they might reliably pass or fail on
# a specific variant, because the results will be flaky dependening
# on Chrome OS infra choices.

# These almost always fail (though occasionally flake to a Pass) on
# asuka GT1 and lars GT1

# This test runs a client side Bluetooth quick health package.
# The package is running several sub batches of tests.
# A batch is defined as a set of tests, preferably with a common subject, e.g
# 'AVLHCI' batch, or the 'AVLDriver' batch.
# The quick health test package is improving test time by doing the minimal
# cleanups between each test and test batches, saving the auto-test ramp up
# time of about 90-120 second per test.
#
# Purpose: Package of Bluetooth quick health client side tests

# Deprecated variables:
#     TIME = 'SHORT' # Takes ~1 minute on zork
#     TEST_CATEGORY = 'Functional'

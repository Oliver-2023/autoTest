    This test runs a client side Bluetooth quick health package.
    The package is running several sub batches of tests.
    A batch is defined as a set of tests, preferably with a common subject, e.g
    'AVLHCI' batch, or the 'AVLDriver' batch.
    The quick health test package is improving test time by doing the minimal
    cleanups between each test and test batches, saving the auto-test ramp up
    time of about 90-120 second per test.

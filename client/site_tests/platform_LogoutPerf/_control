This test measures the time elapsed for signing out from a logged on

The test logs in using the telemetry gaia_login flag, and navigates to
accounts.google.com to verify that we're logged in to gaia, as opposed
to fake telemetry login, then we press the ctrl+shift+q twice to sign
out and measures the time elasped between the uptime metric 'logout-started'
and 'chrome-exec'.

DOC = """
This test starts 5 loopback peer connections, each with 4 streams with
different resolutions. The test then switches randomly which of the streams are
active for each connection, effectively flipping between different resolutions.

If any of the video elements gets a resolution that is lower than the lowest we
request, the test fails.

The tests use a fake media stream - not a real camera.

This test acts as a stress test and ensures that we do not encounter issues
such as https://crbug.com/758850 again.

  Tests that shill can renew leases through dhcpcd, and deconfigures an
  interface when the DHCP server does not renew the license.

  This test fails if shill ignores the T1, T2, or lease timeouts.  Since
  the logic handling these timeouts is handled through dhcpcd, this tests
  some of the interraction between shill and dhcpcd.

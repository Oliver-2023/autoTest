This suite runs various autoupdate tests M to N. This means the tests will
update from a previous milestone to the current milestone.

Most autoupdate tests go N->N and update from a version to itself. This M->N
suite should catch regressions that are missed by N->N tests.

This suite specifically includes testing AU with firmware updates.

This is the faft_pd_unstable test suite.

This suite is a proving ground for USB PD tests before the tests are promoted
to the faft_pd suite. Flaky test should also be moved here while they're being
worked on.

This suite only tests a single Type-C port connecting to the PDTester device
(Servo v4 or Servo v4p1). This test suite is configured to run against the
faft-cr50 pool in the lab, because that pool has the required servo debug
connection. Only port 0 is tested in the lab.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex: x86-mario-release/R17-1412.33.0-a1-b29
@param board: The board to test on.  Ex: x86-mario
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
@param SKIP_IMAGE: (optional) If present and True, don't re-image devices.

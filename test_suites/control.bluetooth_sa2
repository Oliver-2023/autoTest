DOC = """
This suite runs a subset set of all stable Bluetooth functional tests for hardware and
software which doesn't require a peer device. This was created because bluetooth_sa suite
is running over the 3 hour time limit. This will be deleted once bluetooth tests are
ported to tast and all tests can run under the suite time limit

All stable bluetooth tests will be added to bluetooth/bluetooth_sa/bluetooth_sa2 suites.

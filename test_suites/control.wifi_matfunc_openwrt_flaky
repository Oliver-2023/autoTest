The suite is a placeholder for new WiFi Tast tests.

It is the landing suite for new/ported WiFi Tast tests. After a test is
stable enough (say at least the same pass rate compare to Autotest
version), the test can be moved to suite:wifi_matfunc_openwrt.

Refer to https://goto.google.com/cros-wifi-tast-suites for detail.

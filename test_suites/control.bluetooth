This suite runs the complete set of all stable Bluetooth functional tests for
hardware and software that requires a peer device(s).

bluetooth_sa is the equivalent suite for tests which does not require a peer
device.

All stable bluetooth tests will be added to one of bluetooth/bluetooth_sa
suites except for stress tests, performance tests and MTBF tests.

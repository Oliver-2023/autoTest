This suite is used to run all criticalstaging Tast integration tests (exercising
ARC, Chrome, and the OS itself) on release (a.k.a. canary) builders. See
http://go/tast for more information about Tast.

The only Autotest tests executed by this suite are tast.criticalstaging-*, which
are server tests that execute the tast executable. The tast executable runs
individual Tast tests. The results of these Tast tests are available via
Stainless. The tast.criticalstaging-* tests and this suite always pass as long as
the tast executable itself does not report failure (due to e.g. a lost SSH
connection to the DUT or a timeout).

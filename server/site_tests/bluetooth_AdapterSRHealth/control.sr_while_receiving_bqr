The test verifies that the DUT's suspend/resume
should work well with BQR (Bluetooth Quality Report).

Steps:
1. Enable BQR
2. Connect to the audio device with A2DP profile
3. Check the bqr logs before suspend/resume
4. Starting to suspend/resume
5. Open a 2nd btmon log for BQR log checking
6. After suspend/resume DUT should be able to connect to devices
7. Expect the A2DP devices are connected after suspend/resume
8. Check that BQR doesn't break the suspend/resume and vice versa

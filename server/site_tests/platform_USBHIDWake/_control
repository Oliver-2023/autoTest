DOC = '''This test checks to see whether a USB HID Device is capable of waking
a DUT in the S3 state. It requires user interaction (to press a button
on an attached HID device), and also that a HID device is plugged into
the DUT. The openvt binary (emerge emerge sys-apps/kbd) should be available
so that the user prompting code can work'''

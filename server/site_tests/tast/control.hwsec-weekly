Run the weekly hwsec-related tests. Tests in the weekly hwsec-related group
are usually tests that are not stable enough or cheap enough to be in the
mainline/critical group.

Tast is an integration-testing framework analagous to the test-running portion
of Autotest. See https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/tast/ for
more information.

This test runs Tast-based hwsec tests against a remote DUT.

See http://go/tast-failures for information about investigating failures.

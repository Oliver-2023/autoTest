This test run is designed to check that the connection manager
re-scans a few times before quiescing after losing a connection.
We simulate this by shutting off an AP in full sight of the
DUT, waiting for a bit, and then re-instating the AP.  We choose
a hidden AP since this requires the connection manager to do the
scans (since only the connection manager knows to scan for them,
as opposed to wpa_supplicant).

WiFi and BT share an antenna on most wifi modules. This test tests a sequence
of turning off/on wifi mixed with turning off/on BT to check that at the end
of the sequence, both wifi and BT are functional. This protects against
firmware bugs in one subsystem that won't release the antenna and cause
a deadlock state for the other subsystem. See b/79233533.

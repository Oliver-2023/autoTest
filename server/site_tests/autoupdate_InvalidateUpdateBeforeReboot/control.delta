This tests the invalidate last update feature.

This test ensures that Update Engine checks for and invalidates a previous
update if it has not rebooted into it. This is achieved by feeding a full update
to the update_engine followed by a request to invalidate the update.

Refer to autoupdate_Basic's control.delta file for instructions on how to run
this test locally from your workstation.

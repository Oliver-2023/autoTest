Test that setting the serial number in firmware during an onsite RMA works.
Mainboards for onsite RMA will have WP# asserted, flash WP bit cleared,
the serial_number in VPD set to all spaces, and be in dev mode. After the
serial number is set in firmware flash write protect will be enabled and
the device will be in normal mode.

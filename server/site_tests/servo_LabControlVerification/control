"""
This test uses a servo host as DUT and then verifies that basic servod
controls work on it, that are required for critical lab functionality.
Additionally, it tries to ensure that all consoles (cr50, EC, and AP) are
addressable.

This test needs to run on a device that has a servo attached to it so
it can act as a servo host. Additionally, a decently functional DUT needs to
hang on the servo so that the controls can have meaningful output.

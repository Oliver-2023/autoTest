This tests an M-to-N update. That means it will update from the current stable
version for this board to ToT. This test will be used in the CQ to ensure
changes don't break autoupdate.

Refer to control.delta for instructions on how to run this test locally.

Note: for m2n tests, the source version is the currently serving stable channel
version.

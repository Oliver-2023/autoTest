This is a rollback test for ChromeOS releases. It first updates a machine and
then invokes rollback to boot from its previously booted partition. It tests
rollback using the update_engine_client rather than manipulating the UI.

Refer to autoupdate_Basic's control.delta file for instructions on how to run
this test locally from your workstation.

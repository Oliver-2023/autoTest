"""
The local version of servo_LabstationVerification. Local in this context means
that for the tests that require an image to be placed on the usb stick to run
the test will assume an image is already present, and not attempt to download
and image itself.

For more details, please see the DOC section in the file 'control'.

Sample usage:
  test_that <labstation ip> servo_LabstationVerification.local

  test_that <labstation ip> servo_LabstationVerification.local
    --args="dut_ip=${DUT_IP}"
  // To skip DUT ip inferring and use a known DUT ip
